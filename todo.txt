- more ways to highlight changes:
  - display only signs (currently only way)
  - display signs + line highlighting
  - display only line highlighting (make signs invisible using <char-0x0a> text
  - Make a toggle function!

- instead of every time unplacing and replacing all signs,
  only add newly added signs and remove old unneccessary signs
  -> should be faster.
